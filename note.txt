What is React and how can you best describe it ? 
Ans: That’s a really kind of controversial question depending on who you ask, I guess, because a lot of people see it as like a framework or like a library and what not.
So the opinion is always kind of divided in the React community.
I see it more like a library of sorts, right? For JavaScript to create UI interfaces.

What is JSX?
Ans: JSX is essentially kind of like the templating language for React, right?
Kind of like you have it in backend applications where they use templating languages.
You have the same in React where you can basically insert JavaScript inside of HTML — which is kind of like its own thing called JSX
What are some of the benefits of having JSX and the ability to put JavaScript in HTML?
Ans: That I’m not really sure of.
But I really enjoy working in JSX because I like having the option of using JavaScript inside essentially HTML and having some of the flexibility there.
